# Punch Reader

This is a small web application designed to read punched card images generated by [kloth.net](http://www.kloth.net/services/cardpunch.php). The inspiration for developing this web app comes from trying to solve a problem in the EKTOPARTY CTF where the task was to decode a large number of punched card images.

The images must have an exact size of 588 x 264 or else this tool won't work. For an example try clicking on one of the sample images provided.
